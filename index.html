            Greetings,
            Black dark clouds brought down rain and made the desert floors muddy and black ice here and there. Jake and me waited out the last part of winter in Bodie, until the sun came out every day, meltin' all the snow on the paths we wuz walkin' to git through the Sierra Nevadas and arrive in Tonopah by early spring. Every year we would meet up with our friend, Jim Ramsey, who had just opened his new general store in Goldfield and Bob Morgan who came from Golden, Coloradee. The other two fellas from Old Town Sacramento would join us later at the Mizpah or the BelVada.
            "Yes, fer sure" I says to my best pal, Jake. "This year will be a great year for prospectin' and going through the diggings of that thar new mine just discovered in Goldfield, Nevadee. Wonder if they named it yet? Say Jake, remember that Jon Aurich and Chet Myers that used to hang out at the Mozart? Well, by golly, I ran into old Jon and he asked me again what's the name of your secret mining pal, hee,hee, hee? Ya, know Jake, he's rounded up a bunch of burros. Wonder what he's gonna do with them?
            Ya better stay away from him...Jake gives him that famous look, as if saying "Really, dude?" Jest kidding, Jake. That feller's okay. So is the dynamite guy they call Fireworks Bob. Mighty gentle soul. Oh, and Jake, did I tell ya, thar's that new sheriff in town. I believe his name is Nick. Virgil Earp is still a deputy sheriff so they might make good in Goldfield, ya know, formin' a posse if need be. They're sayin' Goldfield is getting' rowdy with all them new miners, madams and saloons poppin' up all over. Maybe those preachers and the Sisters' lookin' to build a church and hospital will do so. They're both gonna be needed. Well, let's git going and until next time, keep on searchin'! Happy Prospectin"!
